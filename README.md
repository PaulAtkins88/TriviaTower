# TriviaTower
Trivia game where if you get the answer correct the little dude will climb the tower. Work in progress.

# 23/05/2019 - night shift at work
## another major update
Too many changes to mention. Updated sprite sheets. added characters. drew the tower. implemented a timer for questions. the dude climbs. tidied up code a bit (more to be done here). Tonight (as in night shift #2) might pop in some audio stuff.. Try and figure out WHY the dude wont render in front of the tower or might just redraw him to a profile view and have him climb the side of the tower.

##### finally worked out where my readme file goes everytime! When i commit from eclipse without doing a 'pull' first i loose the bloody readme.
